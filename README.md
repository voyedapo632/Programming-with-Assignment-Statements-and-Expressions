# Assignment Statement
In computer science a assignment statement is a statement used to assign a value to a variable.\
An example of this can be seen as following:
```
// Declare a variable with type of int called "x"
int x;

/*
* Assigns the value of 10 to the varaible "x"
* Note that the "=" is used as the assignment operator
*/
x = 10;
```

# Assignment Expression
An assignment expression is the value set to a variable. The expressions may contain mathematical operations, variable values, constants, and/or calls to functions.
An example is seen as following:
```
final float PI = 3.141;
float deg = 45.0f;

// The "deg * PI / 180.0" is the expression
float degAsRad = deg * PI / 180.0;
```
